MyType is an interactive typeface generator that determines its parameters on
the basis of answers to a survey of personal questions input by the user. One pre-existing
typeface is correlated with each possible answer, and each question is aligned with one
segment of the new letter form. On completion of the survey the user has created a
hybrid piece of typography which reflects their responses. MyType has been created in
Processing using the p5.js core library DOM, and utilises a variety of renowned typefaces
by typographers such as Paul Renner, Howard Kettler and other notable designers. This
product is the culmination of my interest in typography and particularly the creation of
abstract letter forms.
